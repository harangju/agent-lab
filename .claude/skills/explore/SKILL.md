Explore $ARGUMENTS.

Use the Semantic Scholar MCP tool (low rate limits) to find and verify papers — don't assume what a paper says without checking.

Parallel search — everyone searches independently:
- Skeptic: find all prior and competing work. What's been done? What's claimed?
- Connector: find complementary work in adjacent fields. What frameworks or methods from other disciplines apply?
- Visionary: identify the highest-impact gaps and opportunities. Where is the field stuck? What would be a breakthrough?

Then synthesize: share findings, argue about what matters, and produce a landscape map with gaps ranked by importance.
