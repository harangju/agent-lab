description: Explore a topic — parallel literature search and landscape mapping
---
Create an agent team to explore $ARGUMENTS.

Parallel search — no presenter, everyone searches independently:
- Skeptic: find all prior and competing work. What's been done? What's claimed?
- Connector: find complementary work in adjacent fields. What frameworks or methods from other disciplines apply?
- Visionary: identify the highest-impact gaps and opportunities. Where is the field stuck? What would be a breakthrough?

Then synthesize: share findings, argue about what matters, and produce a landscape map with gaps ranked by importance.
