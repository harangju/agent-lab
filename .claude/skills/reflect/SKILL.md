description: Reflect on past sessions and propose lab norms
---
Read all files in `log/`. Identify recurring patterns in PI feedback — tie-breaks, corrections, quality signals, and persona calibration notes.

Present your findings to the PI:
1. Candidate norms (patterns that appeared 3+ times)
2. One-off feedback that might become a norm with more evidence
3. Persona calibration suggestions (any persona consistently too aggressive, too passive, or off-target)

Do NOT write to any files. The PI decides what to keep. After PI approval, update the Lab Norms section in `CLAUDE.md` and persona prompts in `personas.md` if needed.
