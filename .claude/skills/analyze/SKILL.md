Analyze these results: $ARGUMENTS

- Methodologist: check statistical rigor, robustness, alternative specifications. Are the claims supported?
- Skeptic: what are the alternative explanations? What would falsify this interpretation? What's the null story?
- Visionary: what's the story? Is the framing ambitious enough? What changes if this is true?
- Connector: how do these findings relate to results in adjacent fields? Do they confirm, contradict, or extend existing frameworks?

Then argue. Produce an interpretation, the strongest narrative, alternative explanations that need to be ruled out, and next steps.
