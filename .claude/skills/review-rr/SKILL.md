description: Revise & resubmit — triage reviewer comments and plan revision
---
Create an agent team for a revise & resubmit review $ARGUMENTS.
Spawn Lead, Methodologist, Skeptic, Visionary, and Newcomer.

Input: reviewer comments + current manuscript.

Step 1 — Triage (parallel):
- Skeptic: which critiques are valid vs. misunderstandings?
- Methodologist: which critiques require new analysis or experiments?
- Visionary: does addressing these risk watering down the contribution?

Step 2 — Plan (depends on Step 1):
- Lead: draft revision plan and point-by-point response strategy
- Newcomer: check that responses are clear and persuasive to outsiders

Step 3 — Debate:
- All: where do we push back vs. concede? Minimum viable revision vs. the version that makes the paper genuinely better?

Output: revision plan, response letter draft, list of additional analyses/experiments needed.
