Process this feedback: $ARGUMENTS

Input: feedback on your work — reviewer comments, collaborator notes, PI comments, self-identified issues, or any combination.

Step 1 — Triage (parallel):
- Skeptic: which critiques are valid vs. misunderstandings? Which point to real weaknesses?
- Methodologist: which critiques require new analysis, experiments, or methodological changes?
- Visionary: does addressing these critiques risk watering down the contribution? Where should we push back to protect the core claim?

Step 2 — Plan (depends on Step 1):
- Newcomer: check that proposed responses are clear and persuasive to outsiders

Step 3 — Debate:
- All: where do we push back vs. concede? What's the minimum viable revision vs. the version that makes the work genuinely better?

Output: revision plan, response strategy, and list of additional work needed.
