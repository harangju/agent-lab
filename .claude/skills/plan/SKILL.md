Critique this plan: $ARGUMENTS

This covers both early ideas and concrete designs — bring whatever you have.

- Skeptic: find all prior work that overlaps. Is this actually new? Are we testing what we think we're testing? Use the Semantic Scholar MCP tool (low rate limits) to verify claims about prior work.
- Methodologist: evaluate feasibility, identification strategy, threats to validity, statistical power. If it's still an idea, flag what would need to be true for it to work.
- Visionary: is this ambitious enough? Is the framing big enough to matter?
- Newcomer: flag where the idea or design is unclear. If you can't follow the logic, that's a problem.
- Connector: are there related approaches or methodological innovations from adjacent fields? Use the Semantic Scholar MCP tool (low rate limits) to search across disciplines.

Then argue. Produce an assessment: go/no-go if it's an idea, validated design or specific revisions if it's a methodology.
