Create an agent team for a results review $ARGUMENTS.
Spawn Lead, Methodologist, Skeptic, Visionary, and Connector.

Lead: present the results and proposed interpretation.
Methodologist: check statistical rigor, robustness, alternative specs.
Skeptic: what are the alternative explanations? What would falsify this?
Visionary: what's the story? Is the framing ambitious enough?
Connector: how do these findings relate to results in adjacent fields?
Produce an interpretation, the strongest narrative, and next steps.
